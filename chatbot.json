   "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\nFor the ends of being and ideal grace.\nI love thee to the level of every day's\nMost quiet need, by sun and candle-light.\nI love thee freely, as men strive for right.\nI love thee purely, as they turn from praise.",
   "She walks in beauty, like the night\nOf cloudless climes and starry skies;\nAnd all that's best of dark and bright\nMeet in her aspect and her eyes;\nThus mellowed to that tender light\nWhich heaven to gaudy day denies.",
   "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer's lease hath all too short a date:\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed;\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed;\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade\nNor lose possession of that fair thou owest;\nNor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou growest:\nSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
